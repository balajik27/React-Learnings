1. Diffrence between state and props?

State - to manage data inside a component.
Props - data that component receives from parent component.

2. Create new react project?

npx create-react-app app_name

It will create dummy application , bundlers , setup for testing , ready to go live application.
Packaging content - wrapping the code to make ready to run in production.
Build - use bundlers , like webpack (created by react) . it compile our project and run in localhost.
